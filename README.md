# Golang library to parse Wiktionary data

The aim of [this library](https://github.com/ianpattison-google/wiktionary-golang) is to convert Wiktionary data from its raw Wikitext form to JSON.

## Usage

~~~
GetWord(word string, langCode string) (LanguageWord, error)
GetWordWithOptions(word string, langCode string, options WiktionaryOptions) (LanguageWord, error)
~~~
- word = the required word to be parsed
- langCode = the code for the language of the word (see languages.go)
- options = options for more control (see core.go)

## Example
~~~
import (
	"github.com/ianpattison-google/wiktionary-golang"
)

func main() {
		lw, err := wiktionary.GetWord("red", "en)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalln(err)
		}
	}
}
~~~
lw is a structure containing the parsed word, and a JSON version will be written to the working directory if required.

The JSON output looks like this (example is the English word 'red') - this will vary dependent on the options chosen - NB a large number of cognates and translations have been omitted for brevity.

## core.go

- Define constants which show the sections we are interested in - you can choose to include or omit sections such as anagrams, synonyms etc

- Define constants which represent the language codes

- GetWord - given a word and language, return a LanguageWord object (an in-memory representation of our target JSON structure) with all sections, and etymology for all languages

  - This function is mainly a wrapper for the internal function processWord

- GetWordWithOptions - as GetWord, but giving more control over the required sections and languages

- GetMeaning - call processWord but only get the Meanings section, and return the meaning

  - NB we want to change this to get meanings from Wordnet - this will help us to cluster similar words for etymological analysis
  - The challenge here is around homonyms - for example if we find a word ‚Äòbear‚Äô - does it mean the animal, or to carry something?

- GetTranslations - call processWord but only get the translations for the languages specified

- GetIpaPronunciation - call processWord but only get the IPA translation

- GetEtymologyTree - wrapper for the internal function getEtymologyTree

- GetLanguageFromCode - wrapper for the internal function getLanguageFromCode

- processWord - the main controlling function

  - Get the JSON content from Wiktionary (getWordDataFromWiktionary)
  - Extract the Wikitext (getWikitext)
  - Process the Wikitext into sections (processWikitext)
  - Get the relevant sections for the specified language (extractLanguageSections)
  - Parse the language sections and build a LanguageWord structure (parseSections)
  - For debug purposes we also write a JSON file (writeJson) and a Wikitext file


## raw-data.go

- Define a Section struct as a header plus an array of lines

- getWordDataFromWiktionary - construct a URL and call the Wiktionary API, returning the body of text

- getWikitext - use regex to find the Wikitext block in the JSON - call convertWikitext when done

- convertWikitext

  - Decode any surrogate pairs - these would be found in languages such as Avestan - and replace with an equivalent rune

    - NB this is clunky, we need to see if there is a better way to do this

  - Decode backslash encoded characters

    - NB can we parse the HTML text which matches the WIkitext to get this?

- processWikitext

  - Split the Wikitext into a slice of strings

  - Group the lines into sections by finding a section header and then appending each line until we find another section - we can ignore

    - The end of language marker (four dashes) as this is implied by finding a new language header
    - HTML comments
    - Categories (we don‚Äôt process them)
    - Blank lines

- extractLanguageSections - iterate through all the sections and return only the ones from the language header to the next language header

  - NB can we do this with indexes rather than copying line by line?

- getLanguageFromCode - return the language name

- getPageTitle - work out the page title, which will be different if we‚Äôre dealing with a reconstructed word

- getConvertedTextFromWiktionary

  - Make a call to Wiktionary‚Äôs API with an isolated tag - this is usually to get a human-readable version of Wikitext for etymology purposes
  - API to be called (this example is for the text in the page _red_) https&#x3A;//en.wiktionary.org/w/api.php?action=**parse**&text=**{{cog|nds|root}}**&prop=**text**&title=**red**&formatversion=**2**&format=**json**
  - Select the part from text‚Äù:‚Äù up to \\n&lt;/p>
  - Remove everything in HTML braces &lt;>
  - Replace explicit spaces (&amp;#32, &amp;nbsp, etc) with actual spaces
  - NB we changed to using the HTML5-compliant parser in _golang.org/x/net/html_


## process-wikitext.go

- parseSections

  - Create the LanguageWord (LW) object which all subsequent functions will write into

  - Iterate over the sections and call parseSection

  - Assign a meaning based on the etymology

    - NB can we do this based on Wordnet?

- parseSection - based on the section type, call the relevant section parsing function

- parsePronunciationSection

  - Process each line beginning with \* and add it to the LW
  - Audio lines need some special handling to add a link to the audio file
  - Get the first IPA tag and also store that separately
  - NB we usually attach this to the LW at the word level, but if there are homographs (spelled the same, pronounced differently) then we add it to the etymology level

- parseEtymologySection

  - Process each line (which represents a paragraph of text)
  - Get the text so we have a human-readable representation
  - Call parseLinkedWord to get the individual linked words

- parseLinkedWord

  - Process each tag in the line - ignore **_m_** tags for now
  - Process root word, inherited, cognate and descendant words
  - Handle non-standard inheritance - borrowings, calques and semantic loans
  - Handle any provided transliteration
  - If we have non-Latin script but no transliteration, get one from the etymology text

- parseDescendantSection

  - Process each line and call parseLinkedWord to get the individual linked words

- parsePartofSpeechSection

  - Read the headword line and get the tags
  - Read the meaning lines, but ignore quotations for now
  - Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs call a specific handling function at this point
  - For simpler words (usually in non-English languages) we may need to create an etymology if one doesn‚Äôt exist in the WIkitext

- parseNoun

  - Check for noun gender - usually parameter 1, or explicitly defined
  - Get feminine and masculine forms if they exist
  - Countability will be param 1, or param 2 for gendered languages
  - Get the headword forms (plural, genitive, diminutive etc)

- parseAdjective

  - Get the headword forms (plural, masc/fem, comparative, superlative, etc)

- parseVerb

  - Get the headword forms (there are potentially many - simple past, particples, past tense, imperative, infinitive, etc)

- getHeadwordForm

  - Get the headword from the text
  - NB many of the headword forms are computed by Wiktionary based on minimal Wikitext input - so we need to parse the resultant text to find them

- getHeadwordItem

  - Get the part of the headword text in braces and split by commas

- parseTranslationSection

  - We only translate the first block of translations to get the core meaning of the word
  - For each line, read the language and word
  - Add these to the current etymology

- parseOtherSections

  - For other sections such as synonyms, antonym and anagrams we just get a list of the items

- Helper functions

  - getAllTags - returns all WIkitext tags in the given text
  - searchForTag - find a specific tag in the given text
  - splitTag - given a complete tag, splits it into a map of position and parameters
  - sectionRequired - returns true if the given section is specified in the options
  - languageRequired - returns true if the given language is specified in the options


## etym-tree.go¬†

- This is experimental, we are trying to build a tree of words across languages and history


## json-output.go¬†

- Defines structs used in the JSON output
- writeJson - writes the JSON to an output file


## languages.go¬†

- Defines a map of language codes and the equivalent language name
- Defines helper variables for specified language subsets
